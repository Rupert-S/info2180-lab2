            <h2>Why Computer Science?</h2>
            <p class="author">September 29, 2021 by Rupert Scott</p>
            <p>Prior to highschool i had no interest in the field until i made my first program using pascal. This program was an employee management system which ended up becoming my School Based Assessment (SBA) for my CXCs.</p>
            <img src="working.png" alt="Illustration picture" class="pic2">
            <p>Even after how happy I was working on and completing that program for my SBA I still was yet to be convinced that that was to be my path in life I was stuck on my childhood dream of becoming a Veterinarian and it would take college to for me to make the change to be where I am now. I went on doing all the core courses nneded to pursue a Veterinarian degree and after going into a class was not schedule to have and one of my friends aiming for a computer science degree was stuck on a problem after multiple attempts we both were at a loss but I was still happy and interested to help her. So, after a day of the both of us trying we finally came upon a way to achieve the needed results for the program and I was overjoyed which was a feeling I had not been feeling in the courses I was doing at the time I then said to myself at that moment this is something I would do everyday of my life.</p>

            <p class="author">September 29, 2021 by Rupert Scott</p>
            <p>Currently I am pursing a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and with this degree I plan to do the things i love about the field which are Backend Development, Web Development, Security Analysis and Data Science. I find these areas interesting as such i am learning all the base languages and techniques to make some of the best websites, applications and programs.</p>
            <img src="lost.png" alt="Illustration picture" class="pic3">
            <p>There are other fields that interest me such as Game Development and in terms of a Masters Degree i am thinking of Artificial Inteligence as i find the concept very intriguing and would like to see how far the field could go. There are some concerns but in the future am sure most systems will have Artificial Inteligence making up apart of it even with soon to be norm self driving cars.</p>
